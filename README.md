| **Complex Term**        | **Simplified Term** | **Why It's Better**                                                                      |
|--------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Initiate                 | Start               | "Start" is a more common word that is instantly understood, saving the reader extra effort. |
| Utilize                  | Use                | "Use" is direct and concise, while "utilize" feels overly formal and unnecessary.         |
| Facilitate               | Help               | "Help" is straightforward and more relatable, improving accessibility.                    |
| Terminate                | End                | "End" is shorter and more familiar, making it easier for readers of all backgrounds.      |
| Ascertain                | Find out           | "Find out" feels natural in everyday language, removing any unnecessary complexity.        |
| Commence                 | Begin              | "Begin" is clearer and more conversational, enhancing reader engagement.                  |

One makes their message clearer and more inclusive.
## 7. How can using examples and visuals help in explaining complex concepts more clearly?
